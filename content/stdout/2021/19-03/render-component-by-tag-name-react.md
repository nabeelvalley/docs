When using React it can sometimes be useful to render a standard HTML element given the element name dynamically as a prop

React allows us to do this provided we store the element name in a variable that starts with a capital letter, as JSX requires this to render a custom element

We can do something like this by defining a generic element in React which just takes in the name of the tag in addition to it's usual props and children, something like this:

```jsx
const GenericElement = ({ tagName:Tag, children, ...innerProps}) => 
  <Tag {...innerProps}> 
    {children}
  </Tag>
```

We can then render this element by calling the `GenericElement` with the `tagName` prop and then any children we'd like:

```jsx
<GenericElement tagName="h1">I am an h1</GenericElement>
```
