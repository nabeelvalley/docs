Template literal types provide us a way to combine `string types` or `enums` in Typescript. 

In the below example, we can make use of a `string type` called `Action` and an `enum` called `Resource` to define a type which is a combination of an action combined with a resource

```ts
type Action = 'UPDATE' | 'CREATE' | 'DELETE'

enum Resource {
  Person = 'Person',
  Product = 'Product',
  Sale = 'Sale'
}

// the `Lowercase` type concerts all string type options to lowercase
type ResourceAction = `${Resource}.${Action}`
```

Such that the `ResourceAction` type is now defined as:

```ts

type ResourceAction = 
  "Person.UPDATE" 
  | "Person.CREATE" 
  | "Person.DELETE" 
  | "Product.UPDATE" 
  | "Product.CREATE" 
  | "Product.DELETE" 
  | "Sale.UPDATE" 
  | "Sale.CREATE" 
  | "Sale.DELETE"
```

Now, if you're like me - you probably want your types to be consistent in some way. For this purpose, we can use the `Lowercase` type as follows:

```ts
type ResourceActionLowercase = Lowercase<`${Resource}.${Action}`>
```

Which results in the following types:

```ts
type ResourceActionLowercase = 
  "person.update" 
  | "person.create" 
  | "person.delete" 
  | "product.update" 
  | "product.create" 
  | "product.delete" 
  | "sale.update" 
  | "sale.create" 
  | "sale.delete"
```
