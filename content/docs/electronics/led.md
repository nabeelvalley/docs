LED is short for Light Emitting Diode

# Symbol

LED's are represented with the Diode symbol with 2 arrows added:

# Connecting

When connecting an LED in a circuit it must be connected:

1. in series with a resistor
2. in the correct direction

Below is an example circuit:

## Series Resistor

The resistor to be connected with a specific LED can be calculated by:

$$
R_{LED} = \frac{V_{source} - V_{LED}}{I_{LED}}
$$

Where:

- $V_{source}$ is the voltage over the LED and Resistor
- $V_{LED}$ is the LED's required voltage
- $I_{LED}$ is the current required across the LED

## Direction

The direction that an LED is connected in is very important, both for functioning purposes as well as to ensure the LED is not damaged.

Below is a diagram showing the direction for LED connection, from [Starting Electronics](https://startingelectronics.org/beginners/components/LED/)
