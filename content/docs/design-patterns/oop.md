# Class

- A blueprint for an object
- Fields
- Parameters
- Methods

# Inheritance

- What classes have in common
- Abstracted features
- Override or extend methods
- Avoid duplicate
- Anything in superclass will be reflected in all subclasses

# Main

- Create objects
- Allow them to interact

# Encapsulation

Allows us to validate or perform input information for a field and use _Setters_ and _Getters_

# Instance vs Local variables

- Instance - Defined inside of a class
- Local - Defined in a method

# Polymorphism

- Allow the subclass to redifine methods in the parents
- Refer to subclasses by their superclass type
- Can treat the objects as if they're of the superclass type
- Cannot access methods that only exist in the subclass

# Abstract classes

- Cannot be an object in itself
- May contain state and/or implementation
- Subclasses cannot inherit protected fields

# Interface

- Does not contain an implementation
- Only abstract methods
- Allows classes of different inheritance trees can still communicate
- Avoid interfaces that just force redefinition by subclasses

# Code
