# CI Pipelines

## Static Site

To deploy a static site we make use of the `pages` object. Our script will make a new `public` directory and copy our site files to this directory. The `only` lists the branch from which we want our deployments to run from

Also note that for GitLab Pages Deployments you need to ensure that the deployment arifacts end up in the public directory because Pages cannot deploy from anywhere else

Hence the `cp .public`, `mv .public` stuff

```yaml
pages:
  stage: deploy
  script:
  - mkdir .public
  - cp -r * .public
  - mv .public public
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
  only:
  - master
```



## Angular

We have two stages from our Angular deployment

### Build

During our build stage we install our dependencies, do the application build, and expose our `dist`folder as an artifact which can be passed to our deploy stage

### Deploy

We simply copy the contents of our `dist` folder to our `public` directory. 


Note that we also need to modify our `index.html` file's base url to be `<base href="">` otherwise our app will get a 404 error when trying to get our script and css files




```yaml
build:
  image: node:latest
  stage: build
  script:
  - echo "compile"
  - npm install
  - npm install -g @angular/cli
  - npm run build
  - ls dist
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - dist
  cache:
    paths:
    - node_modules
```



```yaml
pages:
  stage: deploy
  script:
  - ls
  - echo "deploy"
  - ls dist
  - mkdir .public
  - cp -r dist/. .public
  - mv .public public
  - ls public
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
  only:
  - develop
```
