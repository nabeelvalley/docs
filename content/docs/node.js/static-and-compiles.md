# Static Generator and Compilers

This is a simple listing of a few tools that may be useful with a react app (or just generally) when building static sites or compiling things for a Node.js project

## [Minimal CSS](https://github.com/peterbe/minimalcss)

This is a library that will look through code and extract only the minimum required CSS for a page

I have not yet used it, but it is a fairly small project and I'd just like to keep a note of it

> Contribution Idea, ensure that CSS classes in javascript are rendered as well - such as the ones in eventhandlers, etc.

## [React Static](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap)

This also uses the Minimal CSS package above, it's useful for compiling single page apps into static sites with multiple pages and makes use of route-crawling to get all the pages
