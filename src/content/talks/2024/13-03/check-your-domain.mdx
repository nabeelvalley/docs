## Check your domain

</SlideOnly>

> Domain driven development with TypeScript

</Slide>

<Slide>

## Overview

- TypeScript
- The Domain
- Some Problems
- Some tools
- Why do this?

</Slide>

<Slide>

## What is TypeScript?

- Statically typed programming language
- Structural typing system
- OOP and FP
- Compiled to Javascript
- Not "Javascript with Types"

</Slide>

<Slide>

## The Domain

- Manufacturing of Planks
- Sustainable sourcing initiative
- After a plank is cut to size it must pass QA before being shipped

> Code: Defining the Model

</Slide>

<Slide>

<Snippet path="ddd-with-ts/01-domain.ts" />

</Slide>

<Slide>

## Poke some holes

> Code: What potential issues are there in our model

</Slide>

<Slide>

<Snippet path="ddd-with-ts/02-domain-issues.ts" />

</Slide>

<Slide>

### The Usual Solution

- Lots of unit tests
- Documentation
- "Assume it is valid at this point in the code"

- What happens if we delete a check somewhere?
- What happens if the implementation changes?

> Tests are a regression hazard. Documentation goes out of sync

</Slide>

### A Different Solution

> "Make illegal states unrepresentable" - Yaron Minsky

</Slide>

<Slide>

### Some Tools

- Group related things
- String literal types
- String literal types

> Code: Union Types, Template Literal Types

</Slide>

<Slide>

<Snippet path="ddd-with-ts/03-tools-grouping.ts" />

</Slide>

<Slide>

### Impossible States

> Is there anything we have overlooked?

</Slide>

<Slide>

```ts
passedQA: boolean
shipped: boolean
```

What are our states?

- `passedQA=true` and `shipped=false`
- `passedQA=true` and `shipped=true`
- `passedQA=false` and `shipped=false`
- `passedQA=false` and `shipped=true`

> Boolean states are exponential

</Slide>

<Slide>

### Explicit States

- A product in QA
- A product that has completed QA
  - Has been shipped
  - Not yet shipped

</Slide>

<Slide>

### Modeling the desired state

- Union types

</Slide>

<Slide>

<Snippet path="ddd-with-ts/06-tools-union-types.ts" />

</Slide>

<Slide>

### What do we see?

- We actually notice that we have a missing state - what happens if QA does not pass?

</Slide>

<Slide>

<Snippet path="ddd-with-ts/07-tools-add-missing-state.ts" />

</Slide>

<Slide>

### Being 100% Sure

- Can our dimensions be negative?
- Need to validate this

> Code: Option Type and Branded Type usage

</Slide>

<Slide>

<Snippet path="ddd-with-ts/08-tools-branded-types.ts" />

</Slide>

<Slide>

## Why do this?

- Interrogate the domain
- Clarify intent
- Reduces testing

</Slide>
