Using worker threads with Typescript is pretty straightforward, this probably depends a bit on your setup but the below idea seems to work for me

# Single File Worker

In NodeJS we can use a sort of self-referrential worker such that depending on the context in which the file is loaded the behavior will differ, for example:

```ts title="main.ts"
import { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort, workerData } from "node:worker_threads";

// the worker is the current file
const workerFileName = __filename

// define a type for the data we want to share
type WorkerData = {
  id: number,
  name: string
}

// check if we're on the main or worker thread
if (isMainThread) {
  // launch a worker thread
  const worker = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const worker = new Worker(workerFileName, {
      // pass data to the worker
      workerData: {
        id: "my-worker",
        name: "Bob"
      }
    })

    worker.addListener("message", (result) => resolve(result))
    worker.addListener("error", reject)
  })

  worker.then(console.log)
} else {
  // do stuff for the worker thread
  console.log("Running in worker", workerData as WorkerData)
  const message = `Hello ${workerData.name} from worker`

  // return back to the parent thread
  parentPort?.postMessage({ message })
}
```

In the above file we can see a few things that are important to using workers:

1. A check is done using `isMainThread` to determine if the file is being executed as a worker. the handling for the worker is based on this
2. A reference to the file which should be run in the worker thread, the `__filename` variable is defined by NodeJS and holds the name of the curent file - this will be the compiled file name so we don't need to figure that out on our own 
3. A worker is created using `new Worker`, since the worker is an event based API in the above example it's being wrapped in a `Promise` 
4. Data can be passed to the worker via the `workerData` property, this will then be put into the `workerData` variable from `node:worker_threads` in the worker thread
5. Data is sent back to the worker using `parentPort.postMessage`. This is the same even that's being listened for the `Promise` to resolve in `worker.addListener("message", resolve)`

# Multi File Worker

Extending the above to work with multiple files is pretty simple, the only additional trick we need is to export the `__filename` from our worker file to the place where we want to construct the worker

So, the updated code can then be broken into two files as follows:

First, the worker is pretty similar to the one above, except now we export the `__filename` as `workerFileName`

```ts title="worker.ts"
import { isMainThread, parentPort, workerData } from "node:worker_threads";

export const workerFileName = __filename

export type WorkerData = {
  id: number,
  name: string
}

if (!isMainThread) {
  console.log("Running in worker", workerData)
  const message = `Hello ${workerData.name} from worker`
  parentPort?.postMessage({ message })
} else {
  console.log("Worker was run in the main thread")
}
```

The `main.ts` file then makes use of this exported file name to invoke the worker. Note that this is now just a normal script and will be executed in the main thread as normal

```ts title="main.ts"
import { Worker } from "node:worker_threads"

// import the worker file name from where we defined the worker
import { workerFileName } from "./worker"

const workers = [1, 2, 3, 4].map(id => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const worker = new Worker(workerFileName, {
    workerData: {
      id,
      name: `Bob ${id}`
    }
  })

  worker.addListener("message", (result) => resolve({ id, result }))
  worker.addListener("error", reject)
}))

async function main() {
  const results = await Promise.all(workers)
  console.log(results)
}

main()
```
