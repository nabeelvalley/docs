I came across this quote on [Chris Krycho's Website](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/cv/#philosophy-ratchets-not-levers) that I thought was worth sharing:

> "The real wins, then, are tools which do not require everyone to be at their best at every moment: ratchets, not levers. Levers let you move things, but if you are holding something up with a lever, you have to keep holding it — forever. A ratchet lets you drive forward motion without slipping back as soon as you let up on the pressure."
