Coat Rack is a platform that provides users with the necessary tools to own and share their data within their physical space. Enabling non-technical users to take control of their data ownership is the foundation on which the platform is built.

This enables users to take their daily utilities off the cloud and move their data to something they own while providing a user experience that is on par with that of cloud-based applications.

I've been working on the project with [Logan Dam](https://ldam.co.za/about) since early 2024. I recently gave a presentation on the project and though this may be a good time to mention it on my site as well. You can also find the [coat-rack repo on GitHub](https://github.com/coat-rack/app) if you'd like to contribute or just browse
