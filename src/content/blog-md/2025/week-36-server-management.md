# Off topic

I came across [this explainer](https://biomousavi.com/difference-between-process-nexttick-setimmediate-and-settimeout-in-node-js) on the different task queues and related methods in Node.js

# What I Found

I've been looking into/exploring some solutions for self hosting and had a little exploration/review of some tools with [Kurt Lourens](https://kurtlourens.com/) on some of the tech that's available

## Traefik

[Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik) is a reverse proxy that integrates really nicely with Docker by letting you configure endpoints via the container configuration in your environment

## Caddy

[Caddy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy) is a web server and reverse proxy that supports TLS out of the box and is really nice to configure

## Portainer

[Portainer](https://github.com/portainer/portainer) is a management layer and UI for Docker and Kubernetes
