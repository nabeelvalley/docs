I just had to boot up my computer to download _Microsoft Edge_ because half way through the day I found out that the **Passwords** tab has been removed from the _Authenticator_ app  
  
A few months ago the app notified me that _Autofill_ would stop working - I was okay with this, I just started copying and pasting passwords. Next, the ability to add passwords was removed altogether - well okay, I haven't added a new password in a while so that's also fine. But then today I see that the passwords tab has been straight up removed

[This announcement](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/changes-to-microsoft-authenticator-autofill-09fd75df-dc04-4477-9619-811510805ab6) outlines the details but I absolutely love the solution

So, you have to download Edge after that date. It's the only way to export your passwords. But get this - not just the mobile app, since [the Android app does not support password exporting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/2389677/export-passwords-edge-for-androdi) you're going to have to do this on desktop
