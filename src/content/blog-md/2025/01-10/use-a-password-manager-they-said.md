I just had to boot up my computer to download _Microsoft Edge_ because half way through the day I found out that the **Passwords** tab has been removed from the _Authenticator_ app  
  
A few months ago the app notified me that _Autofill_ would stop working - I was okay with this, I just started copying and pasting passwords. Next, the ability to add passwords was removed altogether - well okay, I haven't added a new password in a while so that's also fine.
