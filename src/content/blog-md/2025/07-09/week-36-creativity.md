I've kind of always wondered how people make those crazy art installations with loads of lights and stuff, turns out there's software that exists for that

# What I Found

Relatively obscure but here are a couple of generative art tools, one for music and one for everything?? They're both kinda fascinating, you should take a look

## Strudel

[Strudel](https://strudel.cc/) is an a programming based music performing software that also looks super sick

## TouchDesigner

While diving into some art on the internet this name kept coming up. [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/) is a node based application for creating generative art and art installations that work with loads of different input and output types
