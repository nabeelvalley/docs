      <h2>Nice, France</h2>

      <p>
        We spent some time in the South of France recently.
        The weather for the entire trip was pretty fabulous, warm, sunny, beachy days.
        Most of our trip was spent in Nice where we stayed right on the border of the old city, filled with lovely markets and great food.
        The short walk up to the waterfall - Cascade du Château - was also fantastic and had a wonderful view of the coastline

      <h2>Menton, France</h2>

      <p>
        We also spent a little time exploring the region by train, my favourite stop was Menton - the entire city was pretty much yellow an orange.
        Just a short train ride from Nice - lovely beaches and a lot less busy

      <h2>Monte Carlo, Monaco</h2>

      <p>
        I wasn't a huge fan of Monaco. Not very pedestrian friendly. The architecture was really interesting though, and the water was clearer than anything I've ever seen

      <h2>Ventimiglia, Italy</h2>

      <p>
        Deciding to explore a bit further we took the first stop in Italy, Ventimiglia. A quiet coastal town. It's weird how just crossing the boarder you can immediately feel a shift in the atmosphere around you

      <h2>A side quest</h2>

      <p>
        I also wanted something to keep my eye on my surroundings so I could hunt out interesting pictures, what drew my attention was the presence of washing hanging outside of windows pretty much everywhere in the region,
        I suppose the sunny weather had something to do with that
