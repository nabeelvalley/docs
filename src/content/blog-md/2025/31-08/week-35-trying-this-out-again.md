Trying to get back into some regular blogging rhythym since if I don't pay attention multiple months pass by between posts

# What I'm working on

*   Wrote a bit about the [impact Go has had](/blog/2025/27-08/problems-are-better-left-solved) on how I write software recently
    
*   Wrapped up work on [Déjà vu](https://github.com/sftsrv/dejavu) which is a command line app to bring documentation to developers when they need it
    
*   Learning SwiftUI, basically watching pretty much everything [Paul Hudson](https://www.youtube.com/@twostraws) and [Karin Prater](https://www.youtube.com/@SwiftyPlace) have made
    

# What I found

## Mask

Something I spotted a while back and kind of just skimmed over, [mask](https://github.com/jacobdeichert/mask) is a task runner (like `make`) that uses markdown for documenting commands. It seems great and is something I'd like to play around with in future

## Gauge

On the topic of markdown, [Gauge](https://gauge.org/) uses markdown docs to specify test specifications that are then backed by framework/language specific implementations to actually run those specs

## Pages CMS

[PagesCMS](https://pagescms.org/) is a content management system I've been using for a while that provides a nice UI for working with markdown and JSON content and is actually what I'm writing this post on right now
