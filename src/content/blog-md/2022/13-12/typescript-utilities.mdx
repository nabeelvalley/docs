import Snippet from '@/components/Snippet.astro'

Here's a collection of some utility types I've put together:

## Functions

<Snippet  path="ts-utils/functions.ts" />

## Arrays

<Snippet  path="ts-utils/arrays.ts" />

## Objects

<Snippet  path="ts-utils/objects.ts" />

## Strings

<Snippet  path="ts-utils/strings.ts" />

## JSON Schema

Type for inferring a simple JSON Schema into a TypeScript type. I think this will become super useful once Typescript adds support for importing JSON values as `const`. This will mean that using the schema would be something like:

```ts
// currently the `const` part doesn't exist, but would be super cool if we could get here
import schema from './my-schema.json' with { type: 'json', const: true };

export type MySchema = FromJSONSchema<typeof schema>;
```

> The open issue that would make the above possible is this: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/32063

It's relatively trivial to implement some kind of pre-build script that could do this for all JSON schemas but I think it's worth waiting till the TS part of this solution exists because it would be great to be able to infer this statically
