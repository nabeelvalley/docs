this week has been a little insane so i'm actually amazed i've found 5 mins to put this together

# what i found

spent some time playing around with two little projects, one of which are pretty useful and the other is somewhat conceptual

## delta

this is a [cli tool for better git diffs](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) and provides syntax highlighting for your git diff and some git commands. it's also written in rust if you care about that sort of thing

## fancy fonts

i also came across a [font which renders markdown as rich text](https://kuanwh.com/markdown-font/) using some fancy font features. it's a little glitchy but really cool that this works without any JS

additionally, there's also [this font which does syntax highlighting](https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/font-with-built-in-syntax-highlighting/)

overall, fonts are getting pretty cool these days. [the chrome devblog has a cool bit about colrv1 fonts](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/colrv1-fonts) which let us do some pretty fancy things too

it's also worth taking at [this thread](https://x.com/JohannesMutter/status/1824948096205459903) which has some links to font related stuff worth checking out
