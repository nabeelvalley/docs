firstly, a small sadness - i missed the past two posts due to my vacation, but on the other hand i guess i had a vacation so that works out i suppose

# what i'm working on

spent the past week mostly working on a talk that i'm (hopefully) going to be doing towards the end of the month, i also gave a little [intro presentation on nushell](https://nabeelvalley.co.za/talks/2024/03-10/a-nu-er-shell/) that I think went pretty well

# what i found

this week i'm going to be sharing a few sites i've come across of people doing interesting things
