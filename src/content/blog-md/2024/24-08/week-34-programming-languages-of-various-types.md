# what i'm working on

i've been putting some hours into my image editing app and think i have something that technically works, at the moment it doesn't look like much but proves that the visual programming language idea works:

i wrote a [blog post explaining how the application works](https://nabeelvalley.co.za/blog/2024/24-08/unintentionally-made-a-programming-language/){rel="nofollow ugc noopener"} which explains the concepts around everything all the way from shaders to the ui

# what i found

this week was pretty busy but i managed to get some time to speak to some other devs and we got chatting about configuration languages

## rcl

i bumped into [Ruud](https://github.com/ruuda){rel="nofollow ugc noopener"} who works on a [reasonable configuration language](https://github.com/ruuda/rcl){rel="nofollow ugc noopener"} which a language for defining configuration that outputs to more common formats like json

## pkl

this chat also reminded my about [another configuration language made by apple](https://github.com/apple/pkl){rel="nofollow ugc noopener"} which was released a while ago and is a language for config as code with support for validation
