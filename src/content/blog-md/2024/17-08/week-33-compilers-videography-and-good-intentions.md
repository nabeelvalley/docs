# what i'm working on

this week i spent some time writing a small compiler to take my node based ui and compile it into a web gpu shader that i can then render images with - and ... that works now. i'm currently in the process of creating a solution for passing user input data between the ui and the gpu which shouldn't be too difficult - that's pretty much the last thing i need to do before i can have something that i can actually edit some photos with

additionally, i spent far too much time fighting with typescript and wrote a bit about [generic function overloads](https://nabeelvalley.co.za/blog/2024/16-08/optional-parameters-and-overloads-in-typescript/) and [even more generic functions](https://nabeelvalley.co.za/blog/2024/15-08/handling-complex-typescript-generics/)

# what i found

## crafting interpreters

i've been reading [crafting interpreters by Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) which takes you through the entire process of implementing an interpreter for a custom programming language

## the art of showing up

[this vlog by Life of Riza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJzh8X4Z8ys) is a little story about just being present, it's a really uplifting watch and just an exciting little journey overall

## a phoneless summer

[a "TVlog" by Anna Maria Luisa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kseFWPllIo) dealing with the awareness of time passing. excellent vibes and great writing

## then next comes

if you share my internet you may have seen [exurb1a's latest existential crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1OsDWT_DUc) which starts off as a look into a potential future of humanity until it takes us full circle into wishing we had any idea what anything is at all

> and thanks for reading, till next week!
