# what i'm working on

after many months i spent some time on a project i'm working with a friend to build a sort of "home cloud" platform. it's always weird coming to a project having no clue where you left it and trying to stitch some context from whatever happens when you run `pnpm start`

i also found a handy little way to [open links from the vscode terminal](https://nabeelvalley.co.za/blog/2024/28-08/open-terminal-links-in-vscode/)

# what i found

i spent a little time learning about logic programming and came across an interesting talk about some of the challenges when writing libraries

## prolog

a logic programming language - super weird but [this talk on prolog by Michael Hendricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_eYTctGZw8) helped shed some light on how this is something that's actually usable

## standard libraries

i also came across a great talk about some challenges when maintaining something like [the kotlin standard library by Vsevolod Tolstopyatov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxoKilLSJ4k)
