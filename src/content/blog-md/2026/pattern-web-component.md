I made a small web component for defining geometric patterns, you can see the component in action here:

(inspect the JS if you'd like to see what's happening, though it's just some bad SVG stuff)

<script src="/web-components/pattern.js"></script>

<site-pattern scale="20" pattern-x="0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1" pattern-y="1 0 0">
  <svg style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 3/2"></svg>
</site-pattern>
