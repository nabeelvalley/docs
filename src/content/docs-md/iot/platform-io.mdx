[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) provides a bit of a better workflow and development experience for embedded development. Creating applications can be done using the CLI or the [VSCode Extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)

Platform IO applications can be created using the PlatformIO VSCode Extension using the `PlatformIO: PlatformIO Home` command in VSCode

Once the application has been created you will have a nice way to develop embedded applications

The main thing that PlatformIO provides us in addition to the workflow is the ability to manage dependencies a little bit better as well as split code into a few different files

As far as I care, the dependency management is the main reason to use PlatformIO

Dependency management uses the `platformio.ini` file, a simple example of this can be seen below:

<Snippet path="platformio-esp-8266/platformio.ini" lang="ini" />

Adding dependencies can be done using the [PlatformIO Registry](https://registry.platformio.org/) using the relevant command which will create an entry in the `platformio.ini` file

You can install this using the `PlatformIO CLI` which is also included in the VSCode Extension via the `PlatformIO: Open PlatformIO Core CLI`

An example command for adding one of the libraries I have in the above example is:

```sh
pio pkg install --library "adafruit/Adafruit GFX Library@^1.11.9"
```
