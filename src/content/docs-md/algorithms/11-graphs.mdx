# Undirected Graphs

A graph is a set of vertices connected pairwise by edges. Graphs can be huge and have complex properties

## Terminology

- Path: Sequence of vertices conencted by edges
- Cycle: Path whose first and last vertices are the same

## Common Graph Problems

- Path: Is there a path between _s_ and _t_
- Shortest path: what is the shortest path between _s_ and _t_
- Cycle: Is there a cycle
- Euler tour: Is there a cycle that visits each edge exactly once
- Hamilton tour: Is there a cycle that uses each vertex exactly once
- Connectivity: Is there a way to connect all vertices
- MST: What is the best way to connect all of the vertices
- Biconnectivity: Is there a vertex whose removal disconnects the graph
- Planarity: Can you draw the graph on a plane without crossing edges
- Graph Isomorphishm: Do two adjancey lists represent the same graph

One of the biggest challenges is to determine the difficulty of these problems

# Graph API

In general, we can define the Graph API as follows:

<Snippet path="algorithms/graphs/definition.ts" />

## Representations

There are different ways we can represent graphs

### Drawing

We can represent graphs by drawing them, this can provide intuition about the structure but can be misleading


### List of Vertices

We can also represent graphs using a list of vertices, different representations may impose challenges in representing self-loops or parallel edges

### List of Edges

Maintaining a list of edge-pairs in a Set/Linked List/Array/etc.

### Adjacency Matrix

Maintain a two dimensional V-by-V boolean array, for each edge v-w we set `adj[v][w] = adj[w][v] = true` Which is a very efficient method for lookups but is very poor spacially

### Adjacency List

Maintain a vertex-indexed array of lists, this can be any Bag implementation in general

A simple implementation of an adjacency list using a bag can be seen below

<Snippet path="algorithms/graphs/bag-graph.ts" />

The adjacency mechanism works well since in real world applications graphs tend to have a lot of vertices but a small average number of edges per vertex

## Performance Characteristics

| Representation   | Space | Add Edge | Edge Between V and W | Iterate over Vertices |
| ---------------- | ----- | -------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| List of Edges    | E     | I        | E                    | E                     |
| Adjacency Matrix | V^2   | I        | I                    | V                     |
| Adjacency List   | E + V | I        | degree(V)            | degree(V)             |

# Depth First Search

## Maze Exploration

We can search for a path though a maze using a Depth first search such that:

- Vertex = Intersection
- Edge = Passage

### Tremaux Maze Exploration

An early algorithm for exploring a maze is the **Tremaux Maze Exploration** Algorithm which goes as follows:

- Unroll a ball of string behind you
- Mark each visited intersection and visited passage
- Retrace steps when no unvisited options exist

## Algorithm

To find a path from one vertex to another

1. Mark current vertex as visited
2. Recursively visit all unmarked vetices adjacent to current vertex

## Applications

- Find all vertices connected to a given source 
- Find a path between two vertices

## Graph Processing Pattern

We can implement this using the following design pattern by decoupling the Graph Data type from the processing of the graph itself

1. Create a graph object
2. Pass the graph to the processing method
3. Query the graph processing method for information

We can decopuple this by creating a `Paths` type that contains the logic of holding a `Graph` and a `source` vertex. The API of `Paths` can look like so:

<Snippet path="algorithms/graphs/path-definition.ts" />

## Implementation

We can implement DFS using our pattern as seen below:

<Snippet path="algorithms/graphs/dfs.ts" />

The implementation above uses two internal properties - `marked` to track whether a vertex was visited, and `edgeTo` to mark where that vertex was reached from

DFS marks all connected vertices in a time proportional to the sum of their degrees

After the DFS is done it becomes possible to find connected vertices in constant time and we can find a path if one exists in a time proportional to its length
