# Symbol Table API

The idea is to have some kind of key-value association

- Insert a value with a specified key
- Given a key, search for the corresponding value

## Basic Table API

The basic idea is to use an **Associative Array** such that we have the following definition:

<Snippet path="algorithms/symbol-table/definition.ts" />

## Keys and Values

For Values:

- Values are non-null
- Put overwrites an old value

For Keys:

- comparable since it enables us to do some more efficient algorithms
- Immutable types for keys
- Assume keys have some method for testing equality

The requirements for equality are as follows:

- Reflexive - `x == x`
- Symmetric: `x == y iif y == x`
- Transitive: if `x == y` and `x == z` then `x == y`
- Java also has: Non-null: `x == null` is false

> For the sake of simplicity we'll keep our implementation of keys to types that can be compared directly using the javascript `===` operator

## Elementary Implementation

- Unordered List/Sequential Search
  - We could keep a list with a key-value pair in the array
  - Putting requires us to run through and see if the value is already there and overwrite that value or add a new one at the end
  - Getting a value requires us to scan through the entire array till we find the value
- Ordered List/Binary Search
  - We can use a binary search implementation in which we sort based on the key
  - This will then have the same characteristics of a binary search for retreiving values
  - With binary search however, we need to keep the items in order which makes insertions and deletions expensive as we need to shift all items to the right of our key
  - Good for read-heavy usecases

| Implementation    | Worst Case             | Average Case             | Ordered iteration | Key interface |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------- |
| sequential search | N search, N insert     | N/2 search, N insert     | No                | Equality      |
| binary search     | log N search, N insert | log N search, N/2 insert | yes               | Comparison    |

The best above implementation is the binary search but it's still fairly slow for insertion - we want to find an implementation that's more efficient than this

## Ordered Operations

When considering a symbol table it may sometimes be relevant to do things like

- Get the min value
- Get the max value
- Get a value given a key
- Get X top values
- Get some list of keys ina a range
- Floor/Ciel of a key

The API for an ordered symbol table is as follows

<Snippet path="algorithms/symbol-table/definition.ts" />

## Binary Search Trees

Enables us to provide an efficient implementation of symbol tables

Binary search trees are binary trees that are in symmetric order - links in the tree can be null

A binary tree is either:

- Empty
- Two disjoint trees

In a binary search tree each node has a key and every key is larger than all trees in its left subtree and larger than all keys in its right subtree

To implement this we will extend the implementation of a linked list which is doubly linked such

### BST Operations

#### Get

When searching a binary tree, we start at the root and compare the value:

- If less - go left
- If greater - go right
- If equal - return the value

If we end up on a null link that means the value is not in the tree so we return null

The implementation of this can be seen below:

<Snippet
  path="algorithms/symbol-table/binary-search-tree.ts"
  collapse={['1-32', '46-999']}
/>

#### Insert

Follow a similar process as we did for searching, but when we get to a null node then we insert the new node there

An important distinction in the insertion implementation is that we recursively traverse the child branches and modify the parent

<Snippet
  path="algorithms/symbol-table/binary-search-tree.ts"
  collapse={['1-45', '67-999']}
/>

### Tree Shape

In the case of a BST the number of compares in the above operations is 1+node depth

Depending on how insertion works, we can end up in a tree which is heavily skewed which can lead to varying performance. The performance of this may be very bad in the event that the inserts are done in some kind of ordered way

The implementation of a BST is very similar to the idea behind how quicksort works

### Ordered BST Operations

#### Max and Min

To find the max value just keep moving right and to find the min value we just keep moving to the left

<Snippet
  path="algorithms/symbol-table/binary-search-tree.ts"
  collapse={['1-67', '81-999']}
/>

#### Floor and Ceil

To get the floor we need to consider the following:

1. K is equal to the key at the root = the floor is K
2. K is less than the key at the root = the floor is in the left subtree
3. K is greater than the key at the root = the floor is in the right subtree

The ceiling implementation is the same but we traverse the other way instead. We can see the two implementations below:

<Snippet
  path="algorithms/symbol-table/binary-search-tree.ts"
  collapse={['1-81', '127-999']}
/>

#### Counts

Implementing counts can be done by adding a count field to each node which is the number of nodes in that subtree

The way we maintain this is by setting the count of a node as `1+size(left)+size(right)`

#### Rank

Implementing Rank makes use of these subcounts to determine which sides of a tree to traverse and get the next resulting values in a recursive manner

#### In Order Traversal

The method for traversing the tree in order is as follows:

1. Traverse the left subtree
2. Enqueue current key
3. Traverse the right subtree

Implementing the above recursively leads to us having an ordered queue of keys

### Deletion

To delete we can implement a few different solutions. The lazy approach is to remove the value of a key but then we end up accumulating keys in our table

A more general method for deleting nodes is called **Hibbard Deletion**

1. If the node has no children, we just set it's value as null and propogate the change in counts up
2. If the node has 1 child, we can replace the parent link with the child
3. If the node has 2 children, we have to do a few more things:
   - Find the next smallest node in the right subtree
   - Delete the minimum in the right subtree
   - Put the smalest value in the spot of the node we deleted

The problem with the Hibbard deletion process leads to the tree becoming imbalanced over time since we are replacing the right subtree constantly

After a lot of deletes the shape of the tree changes which has a considerable negative impact on the performance of the data structure
