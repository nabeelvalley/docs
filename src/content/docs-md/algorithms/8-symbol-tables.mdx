# Symbol Table API

The idea is to have some kind of key-value association

- Insert a value with a specified key
- Given a key, search for the corresponding value

## Basic Table API

The basic idea is to use an **Associative Array** such that we have the following definition:

<Snippet path="algorithms/symbol-table/definition.ts" />

## Keys and Values

For Values:

- Values are non-null
- Put overwrites an old value

For Keys:

- comparable since it enables us to do some more efficient algorithms
- Immutable types for keys
- Assume keys have some method for testing equality

The requirements for equality are as follows:

- Reflexive - `x == x`
- Symmetric: `x == y iif y == x`
- Transitive: if `x == y` and `x == z` then `x == y`
- Java also has: Non-null: `x == null` is false

> For the sake of simplicity we'll keep our implementation of keys to types that can be compared directly using the javascript `===` operator

## Elementary Implementation

- Unordered List/Sequential Search
  - We could keep a list with a key-value pair in the array
  - Putting requires us to run through and see if the value is already there and overwrite that value or add a new one at the end
  - Getting a value requires us to scan through the entire array till we find the value
- Ordered List/Binary Search
  - We can use a binary search implementation in which we sort based on the key
  - This will then have the same characteristics of a binary search for retreiving values
  - With binary search however, we need to keep the items in order which makes insertions and deletions expensive as we need to shift all items to the right of our key
  - Good for read-heavy usecases

| Implementation    | Worst Case             | Average Case             | Ordered iteration | Key interface |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------- |
| sequential search | N search, N insert     | N/2 search, N insert     | No                | Equality      |
| binary search     | log N search, N insert | log N search, N/2 insert | yes               | Comparison    |

The best above implementation is the binary search but it's still fairly slow for insertion - we want to find an implementation that's more efficient than this

## Ordered Operations

When considering a symbol table it may sometimes be relevant to do things like

- Get the min value
- Get the max value
- Get a value given a key
- Get X top values
- Get some list of keys ina a range
- Floor/Ciel of a key

The API for an ordered symbol table is as follows

<Snippet path="algorithms/symbol-table/definition.ts" />

## Binary Search Trees

Enables us to provide an efficient implementation of symbol tables

Binary search trees are binary trees that are in symmetric order - links in the tree can be null

A binary tree is either:

- Empty
- Two disjoint trees

In a binary search tree each node has a key and every key is larger than all trees in its left subtree and larger than all keys in its right subtree

To implement this we will extend the implementation of a linked list which is doubly linked such

### BST Operations

#### Get

When searching a binary tree, we start at the root and compare the value:

- If less - go left
- If greater - go right
- If equal - return the value

If we end up on a null link that means the value is not in the tree so we return null

The implementation of this can be seen below:

<Snippet
  path="algorithms/symbol-table/binary-search-tree.ts"
  collapse={['1-32', '46-999']}
/>

#### Insert

Follow a similar process as we did for searching, but when we get to a null node then we insert the new node there

An important distinction in the insertion implementation is that we recursively traverse the child branches and modify the parent

<Snippet
  path="algorithms/symbol-table/binary-search-tree.ts"
  collapse={['1-45', '67-999']}
/>

### Tree Shape

In the case of a BST the number of compares in the above operations is 1+node depth

Depending on how insertion works, we can end up in a tree which is heavily skewed which can lead to varying performance. The performance of this may be very bad in the event that the inserts are done in some kind of ordered way

The implementation of a BST is very similar to the idea behind how quicksort works

### Ordered BST Operations

#### Max and Min

To find the max value just keep moving right and to find the min value we just keep moving to the left

<Snippet
  path="algorithms/symbol-table/binary-search-tree.ts"
  collapse={['1-67', '81-999']}
/>

#### Floor and Ceil

To get the floor we need to consider the following:

1. K is equal to the key at the root = the floor is K
2. K is less than the key at the root = the floor is in the left subtree
3. K is greater than the key at the root = the floor is in the right subtree

The ceiling implementation is the same but we traverse the other way instead. We can see the two implementations below:

<Snippet
  path="algorithms/symbol-table/binary-search-tree.ts"
  collapse={['1-81', '127-999']}
/>

#### Counts

Implementing counts can be done by adding a count field to each node which is the number of nodes in that subtree

The way we maintain this is by setting the count of a node as `1+size(left)+size(right)`

#### Rank

Implementing Rank makes use of these subcounts to determine which sides of a tree to traverse and get the next resulting values in a recursive manner

#### In Order Traversal

The method for traversing the tree in order is as follows:

1. Traverse the left subtree
2. Enqueue current key
3. Traverse the right subtree

Implementing the above recursively leads to us having an ordered queue of keys

### Deletion

To delete we can implement a few different solutions. The lazy approach is to remove the value at a key but then we end up accumulating keys in our table

A more general method for deleting nodes is called **Hibbard Deletion**

1. If the node has no children, we just set it's value as null and propogate the change in counts up
2. If the node has 1 child, we can replace the parent link with the child
3. If the node has 2 children, we have to do a few more things:
   - Find the next smallest node in the right subtree
   - Delete the minimum in the right subtree
   - Put the smalest value in the spot of the node we deleted

The problem with the Hibbard deletion process leads to the tree becoming imbalanced over time since we are replacing the right subtree constantly

After a lot of deletes the shape of the tree changes which has a considerable negative impact on the performance of the data structure. This leads to operations on the tree being `O(sqrt(N))`

## 2-3 Trees 

Generalize BSTs to provide some flexibility in defining performance by using trees that can either have:

1. 2-node: one key, two children
2. 3-node: two keys, three children

- Perfect balance: every path from root to end has the same length
- Symmetric order: in-order traversal returns keys in ascending order

### Searching

- Compare search key against keys in node
- Find relevant link
  - Smaller than both keys = left
  - Larget than both keys = right
  - Between keys = between link
- Follow the relevant link recursively

### Insertion

- Search for key
- Either
  - If at 2-node: Replace 2-node with a 3-node
  - If at 3-node: 
    - Create a temp 4-node
    - Move middle key of 4-node into parent
    - Split remaining into 2 2-nodes
    - Do this recursively up as needed

Splitting nodes is a local transformation and thereby has a constant number of operations

### Invariants

- Maintain symmetric order and perfect balance
- Each transformation should maintain symmetric order and perfect balance

### Performance

Since we have perfect balance, every path from the root to the end has the same lenght

Tree height:

- Worst case: lg N (all 2-nodes)
- Best case: log3 N (all 3 nodes)

### Implementation

Implementation of this is possible but it's quite complicated and there is an easier way to implement this          

## Left-leaning Red-Black BSTs

- Represent a 2-3 tree as a BST
- Use internal left-leaning links as 3-nodes

This is a BST such that:

- No node has 2 red likns connected to it
- Every path from root to link has the same number of black links
- Red links lean right

### Search

Search is exactly the same as for a BST but is much faster due to the tree remaining balanced

### Representation

To represent a red-black BST we use the BST definition we had previously but 

### Left Rotation

Sometimes when working with a tree we may end up with a right-leaning red link. We may want to update this to rotateLeft instead which can be done as follows:

<Snippet
  path="algorithms/symbol-table/red-black-binary-search-tree.ts"
  collapse={['1-37', '49-999']}
/>

The important part of the left rotation is that it maintains symmetric order and perfect black balance

### Right Rotation

Sometimes to insert a value it is necessary to temporarily rotat a link right, this can also be done as follows:

<Snippet
  path="algorithms/symbol-table/red-black-binary-search-tree.ts"
  collapse={['1-49', '61-999']}
/>

### Flip Colors

When a node has two child links that are both red this represents a 4-node. In order to split a 4-node it is simply necessary to

1. Convert the parent link to red
2. Convert the 2 child links to black

<Snippet
  path="algorithms/symbol-table/red-black-binary-search-tree.ts"
  collapse={['1-61', '71-999']}
/>

### Insertion

When inserting we want to maintain the 2-3 accordance. 

- Case 1  - insert into a 2-node at the bottom
  - Do a normal BST insert, color new link red
  - If new red link is right, rotate it left
- Case 2 - Insert into a tree with exactly 2 nodes
  - Do a normal BST insert, color new link red
  - Rotate to balance 4 node if needed
  - Flip colors to pass red link up one level
  - Rotate to make lean left if needed
  - Repeat case 1 or 2 up the tree if needed

<Snippet
  path="algorithms/symbol-table/red-black-binary-search-tree.ts"
  collapse={['1-71', '101-999']}
/>


### Performance

Lerft leaning red-black trees will approach lg 2 N hehght, in the worst case it will be 2 lg N

## B Trees

Given some contstraints such as a file system, we have the following:

- Locate a page - slow
- Read a page - fast

We want to optimize in order to minimize the number of propbes that need to be done in order to locate a page

B-trees generalize 2-3 trees by allowing up to M-1 key-link pairs per node where M is as large as possible for the given usecase

- At least 2 key-link paris at root
- At least M/2 key-link paris in other nodex
- External nodes contain client keys
- Internal nodes contain copies of keys to guide search

In practive, the number of probes in a B-tree is at most 4, an optimization that's possible is to keep the root page in memory at all times

## Applications of Symbol Tables and Binary Search Trees

### 1D Range Search

Extension of the ordered symbol table withL

- Insert key-value pair
- Search for key k
- Delete key k
- Range search: find all keys between k1 and k2
- Range count: count number of keys between k1 and k2

A geometric interpretation of this is to think of keys as points on a line

There are a few different ways to implement this:

| Data structure      | insert | range count | range search | 
| ------------------- | ------ | ----------- | -------------|
| Unordered Array     | 1      | N           | N            |
| Ordered Array       | N      | log N       | R + log N    |
| BST with Rank field |        | log N       | R + log N    |

Where:

- N = number of keys
- R = number of keys that match
