Used to work with the problem of connecting objects and determining if those two objects are connected

Refers to the problem when given a set of objects N to be able to:

- Union - Connect two objects
- Connected - Check if a path that connects two objects exists

e.g. Given some set of items that are connected in a network

```
0---1   2   3---4
            |
            |
5   6---7   8---9
```

In the above example we have some items that are connected. In the above set we can ask a question like "Is 3 connected to 9"

# Implementation

In the implementation of the Union Find we will use a `UnionFind` data type that has `union` and `connected` methods

<Snippet path="algorithms/union-find/interface.ts" />

## Quick Find

An implementation can be seen below:

<Snippet path="algorithms/union-find/quick-find.ts" />

## Quick Union

Quick union is an implementation of union find that uses a tree to represent the data structure. In this implementation instead of storing the representative group we store the connections as a forest where each connected set is a tree

<Snippet path="algorithms/union-find/quick-union.ts" />

## Weighted Quick Union

What slows down the quick union is traversing up through a long tree. THe idea here is to avoid tall trees, to do this we need to:

1. Keep track of size of each tree (number of objects)
2. Balance by linking root of smaller tree to root of larger tree

<Snippet path="algorithms/union-find/weighted-quick-union.ts" />

For this algorithm the depth of any node should be at most `lg N` (lg is shorthand for Log with base 2)

## Weighted Quick Union with Path Compression

By modifying the implementation to update the root of any item we read as we read it we can save a lot of read iterations in the future by updating each non-root node to move it a level up when we read it:

<Snippet path="algorithms/union-find/weighted-quick-union-path-comp.ts" />

Since we have flattened the tree at every pass the union time of this agorithm makes it less than `N + M lg* N` (lg\* is a super small value)

# Complexity

| algorithm               | init | union       | find |
| ----------------------- | ---- | ----------- | ---- |
| quick-find              | N    | N           | 1    |
| quick-union             | N    | N (note)    | N    |
| weighted-quick-union    | N    | lg N (note) | lg N |
| weighted-quick-union-pc | N    | lg\* N      | lg N |

> (note) Includes cost of finding the root
