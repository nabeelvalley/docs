# Problem

The same problem as the [Memoization How Sum problem](/dynamic-programming/memoization/5-how-sum) but we want to take a tabular approach which we can do as an adaptation of the [Tabular Can Sum problem](./4-can-sum)

For our purpose, let's initialize the value as our return type of `null` and instead of storing a boolean we will store the current array value which has lead to that sum thus far

```
canSum(7,[5,3,4])-> [3,4]

i                  0    1     2     3     4     5     6     7
is sum=i possible  []   null  null  [3]   [4]   [5]   [3,3] [3,4]
```

At each step we replace the latter element and append the current value that we have

And so, our result is [3,4]

# Tabulation Implementation

The implementation of this can be seen below:

<Snippet path="dynamic-programming/tabulation/how-sum.ts" />

In the above, the time complexity $O(m^2 *n)$ and space complexity $O(m^2)$

> The reason we say $m^2$ and not $m$ in the time complexity is because of the array copy operation that we do to assign the latest value
