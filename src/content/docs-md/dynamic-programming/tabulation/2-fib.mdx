# Problem

Calculate the nth number in the Fibbonnaci sequence with:

1. 0th number as 0
2. 1st number as 1

So the resulting:

```txt
n:      0   1   2   3   4   5   6
fib(n)  0   1   1   2   3   5   8
```

The tabulation strategy consists of building a table but we think of the problem in terms of iteration instead of recursion

In this tabular representation something important to note is that for the value of `n=6` we have an array with the **indices 0 to 6** and a **length of 7**

# Tabulation Implementation

For our implementation we will define a table that has a position for each value we want. For our starting seed we will define an array of 0s and a 1 at index 1, from here we will step through each item and add it to the following two items. This is a bit of a different perspective on the Fibonacci problem than in the [Recursive Fibonacci example](/dynamic-programming/memoization/2-fib)

<Snippet path="dynamic-programming/tabulation/fib.ts" />

In this implementation we have a linear solution with time complexity $O(n)$ and space complexity of $O(n)$

An important thing to note about this solution is that it still represents a tree structure but is represented as a table:
