title: Best Sum with Tabulation
---

import Snippet from "@/components/Snippet.astro";

# Problem

The same problem as the [Memoization Best problem](/dynamic-programming/memoization/5-how-sum) but we want to take a tabular approach which we can do as an adaptation of the [Tabular Can How Sum problem](./5-how-sum) but this time we replace each sub-sum with the shortest sum of the given options

# Tabulation Implementation

The implementation of this can be seen below:

<Snippet path="dynamic-programming/tabulation/best-sum.ts" />

In the above, the time complexity $O(m^2 *n)$ and space complexity $O(m^2)$

> The reason we say $m^2$ and not $m$ in the time complexity is because of the array copy operation that we do to assign the latest value
