# Problem

The same problem as the [All Construct Memoization Problem](/dynamic-programming/memoization/7-can-construct) but implemented using the tabular style in the previous problems

This is almost the same as the [Count Construct solution](./8-count-construct) but instead of incrementing the count we define the new running combination to reach a current position while retaining all other values that have reached that position thus far

For reference see the resulting array for a certain combination:

# Tabulation Implementation

The implementation of this can be seen below:

<Snippet path="dynamic-programming/tabulation/all-construct.ts" />

In the above, the time complexity $O(n^m)$ and space complexity $O(n^m)$. While the resulting complexity is pretty bad it is the best we're going to get for this solution since it explicitly needs a list of all possible combinations
