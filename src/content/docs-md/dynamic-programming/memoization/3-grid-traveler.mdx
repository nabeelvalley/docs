## Problem

A traveler on a 2D grid begins in the top left and must travel to the bottom right corner by only moving down or right

How many ways can you travel to the goal on a grid that is `m*n`

The resulting travel for a 2x3 grid may look like so:

Some special cases we want to ensure we can handle as well:

```js
gridTraveler(1,1) = 1
gridTraveler(m,0) = 0
gridTraveler(0,n) = 0
gridTraveler(m,1) = 1
gridTraveler(1,n) = 0
```

Looking at the example, we can think about how any movement from a point in a grid shrinks the grid in some direction

From this idea we can see that the problem is somewhat recursive, we can visualize this problem as a tree that will look something like this:

![](@assets/grid-traveler-tree.png)

Any node that has a `0` or `1` can be considered the base case where we know the number of routes that can be travelled. Furthermore, we can also see that there are some repeated nodes

## Base Implementation

<Snippet path="dynamic-programming/memoization/grid-traveler.ts" />

This implementation starts to look a lot like the [Fibonacci Implementation](./fib)

In the tree for this implementation the time complexity will be $O(2^(m+n))$ and the space complexity is $O(n+m)$

## With memoization

If we look at the tree we see that some subtrees are repeated directly, so we can try to memoize these.

<Snippet path="dynamic-programming/memoization/grid-traveler-memo.ts" />

Thinking further about it we can consider that the number of solutions of `2,3` is the same as `3,2`. We can also consider this for a further optimization but that is not implemented here
