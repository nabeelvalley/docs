## Base Implementation

Looking at the recursive Fibonacci implementation below:

<Snippet path="dynamic-programming/memoization/fib.ts" />

The time complexity is $O(2^n)$ and space complexity of $O(n)$

The above function gets extremely slow when `n` is large due to the recursive implementation. For example asking for `fib(50)` will have a time of $2^50$

If we visualize the implementation of the above function we will see a tree, for example for `n=7`:

Looking at the subtrees we can see that there is a lot of data that is frequently recalculated and we can try to memoize this data

## With Memoization

We can create a memo object that we pass around that will allow us to access and early escape a calculation

<Snippet path="dynamic-programming/memoization/fib-memo.ts" />

And now running `fib(50)` runs super quickly, this essentially takes the tree and collapses it into a more linear implementation and looks a bit like this:

![Tree with most branches eliminated](@assets/fib-memo.png)

Based on this, the time complexity is now $O(n)$ without a relevant impact on the space complexity which is still $O(n)$
