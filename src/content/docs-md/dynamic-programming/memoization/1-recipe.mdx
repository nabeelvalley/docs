title: Algorithm for Recursive Memoization
---

# The Recipe

The recipe for working with this kind of memoization, and memoization more generally is:

1. Start with some brute force recursion - ensure to have a base case
2. Define a memo and a value that wil be used a key to identify a subtree. This is the parameter that changes
3. Check the memo as another base case, if exists then return
4. Get the new result ensuring to **pass through the memo**
5. **Memoize the new result**
6. Return the new result
