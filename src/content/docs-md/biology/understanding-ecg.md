# Main Features

## The Normal ECG

Durations: 

- PR Interval: 200ms (5 small squares)
- QRS Complex: 120ms (3 small squares)
- QT Interval: 450ms

Rhythm

- Sinus arrythmia
- Supraventricular extrasystoles are always normal

The Cardiac Axis

- Normal axis: QRS upward in I, II, III. Still normal if QRS is downward in III
- Minor degrees of axis deviation are normal

QRS Complex

- Small Q wave in I, VL, and V6
- RSR pattern in V1 normal if less than 120ms
- R wave smaller than S in V1
- R wave less than 25mm in V6
- R + S less than 35mm in V1

ST Segment

- Should be isoelectric

> Isoelectric: "having or involving no net electric charge or difference in electrical potential"

T Wave

- May be inverted in III, VR, V1, V2, V3 (in some people)

## Conduction Problems

First Degree Block

- One P wave per QRS complex
- PR interval greater than 200ms

Second Drgree Block

- Movitz type 2: occasional nonconducted beats
- Wenkebach: progressive lengethening of PR interval, then a non-conducted P wave, and then repeats
- 2:1 (or 3:1) block: two or three P waves per WRS complex with normal P wave rate

Third Degree (complete) Block

- No relationship between P wave and QRS complex
- Wide QRS complex
- QRS complex rate less than 50/min
- Sometimes narrow WRS complex rate (50-60/min)

Right Bundle Branch Block

- QRS duration greater than 120ms
- RSR pattern
- Usually dominant R wave in V1
- Inverted T wave in  V1 and sometimes V2, V3
- Deep and wide S wave in V6

Left Anterior Hemiblock

- Marked left axis deviation - deep S wave in II and III with slightly wide QRS

Left Bundle Branch Block

- QRS complex greater than 120ms
- M pattern in V6 and sometimes V4, V5
- No septal Q waves
- Inverted T wave in I, Vl, V5, V6, and sometimes V4

Bifascicular Block

- Left Anterior Hemiblock + Right Bundle Branch Block

## Supraventricular Rhythms

Common Rhythms

- Sinus rhythm
- Atrial extrasystoles
- Junction (AV nodal) extrasystoles
- Atrial tachycardia
- Atrial flutter
- Junctional (AV nodal) tachycardia
- Junctional (AV nodal) escape
- Atrial fibrillation

Rhythm Abnormalities

- Extrasystoles: single early beats supressing the next sinus beat
- Escape beats: absence of sinus beat followed by late single beat
- Tachycardias
- Bradycardias


### Characteristics of Supraventricular Rhythms

In general

- Narrow QRS (less than 120ms) 
- Same QRS as in sinus rhythm
- Normal T wave

May have a wide QRS if there is a bundle branch block or Wolfff-Parkinson-White syndrome

- Sinus rhythm
  - one P wave per QRS
  - P-P interval varies with respiration
- Atrial or junctional (AV nodal) extrasystoles
  - early QRS complex
  - no P wave, or abnormally shaped (atrial) P wave
  - narrow and normal QRS complex
  - normal T wave
  - nexgt P wave is 'reset'
- Atrial tachycardia
  - P wave rate 300/min
  - abnormal P wave, usually short PR interval
  - Usually more than one P wave per WRS complex, P wave rate sometimes 200-240/min with 2:1 block
- Atrial flutter
  - P wave rate 300/min
  - sawtoothed pattern
  - 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 block
  - block increased by carotid sinsuss pressure
- Junctional (AV nodal re-entry) tachycardia
  - commonly, but inappropriately, called SVT
  - no P waves
  - rate usually 150-180/min
  - carrotid sinus pressure may cause reversion to sinus rhythm
- Atrial fibrillation
  - this si the most irregular rhythm
  - QRS complex over 160/min but can be slower
  - no P wave identifiable, completeley irregular baseline
- Escape ryhthms
 - bradycardias, atrial fibrillation odes not occur as an escape rhythm

## Ventricular Rhythms

Common Ventricular rhythms

- Ventricular extrasystoles
- Accelerated idioventricular rhythm
- Ventricular escape
- Ventricular fibrillation

Rhythm Abnormalities

- Extrasystoles: single early beats supressing the next sinus beat
- Escape beats: absence of sinus beat followed by a late single beat
- Tachcardias
- Bradycardias

### Characteristics of Ventricular Rhythms

In general

- Wide QRS complexes (greater than 120ms)
- different QRS complex from those seen in sinus
- change of axis compared to sinus
- abnormal T waves

- Ventricular extrasystoles
  - early QRS complex
  - no P wave
  - QRS complex wide
  - abnormally shaped QRS
  - abnormally shaped T wave
  - next P wave is on time
- Accelerated idioventricular rhythm
- Ventricular escape
  - Single beats or complete heart block
- Ventricular tachycardia
  - no P waves
  - QRS complex rate greater than 160/min
  - accelerated idioventricular rhythm: like ventricular tachycardia, QRS rate less than 120/min
- Ventricular fibrillation
  - look at the patient not the ECG
  - ECG is totally disorganized, patient will have lost consciousness

## Myocardial Infraction

Sequence of ECG changes

1. Normal ECG
2. Raised ST segments
3. Appearence of Q waves
4. Normalization of ST segments
5. Inversion of T waves

Site of infraction

- Anterior infraction: changes in leads V3, V4, often also V2, V5
- Inferior infraction: changes in leads III anf VF
